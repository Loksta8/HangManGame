Welcome to my first Hangman Game that I created back in 2011. When I first
created this program it was to teach me how to use C++ to solve the problem of
programming Hangman in the C++ Language. I did not know how Object Oriented Style
Programming worked until later on in the years, so my first attempt was written
all in the main function. Eventually I gained more understanding and converted
the code to the more elegant ways of Object Oriented Programming. At first it
was with the class and the main function inside of the same .cpp file. Later I
separated it even further into the most truest form of OOP. It has a .hpp for the
class definition file, the .cpp for the implementation file, and finally a main.cpp
for the main program to run. Hopefully this helps some people who are learning
how to code so that they can see the steps necessary to incorporate converting
their code into OOP style. I know when I first was learning to program this way
it confused me. There were not many examples online that made sense because
books and online examples mainly teach how to put everything in one file instead
of separating them out into their unique definitions and implementations. Thank
you and have fun using the program! Feel free to change it any way you like, or
if you have any feedback I'm all ears for that too! Take care!
